# 🔧 C++ Algorithms Toolkit

A modular, menu-driven C++ project implementing fundamental sorting and searching algorithms using STL vectors and a multi-file architecture.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project is a console-based Algorithms Toolkit built in C++.  
It allows users to:

- Input and manage integer arrays
- Apply sorting algorithms
- Perform searching algorithms
- Validate edge cases (empty arrays, unsorted binary search, etc.)
- Interact through a clean menu-driven interface

The project is structured using header and source files to follow real-world C++ development practices.
